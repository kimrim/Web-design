1. Change the ListView from the last demo to use TABLE instead of UL
--The TableView gets number of rows and columns in its constructor
--The TableView renders the elements in table cells
--Each element gets only a single cell
2. Create a web services that returns a list of students
--Students have first and last name, grade, age and list of marks
--Marks have subject and score
Create a Master-detail for the students and their marks
--Create a template for rendering students
--Create a template for rendering marks
--When student is clicked, their marks must be rendered in another HTML element
